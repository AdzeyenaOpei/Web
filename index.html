                Formula One, commonly known as Formula 1 or F1, is the highest class of 
                international racing for open-wheel single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned 
                by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The FIA Formula One World 
                Championship has been one of the world's premier forms of racing since its inaugural 
                running in 1950. The word formula in the name refers to the set of rules all
                participants' cars must follow. A Formula One season consists of a series of 
                races, known as Grands Prix. Grands Prix take place in multiple countries and 
                continents on either purpose-built circuits or closed roads. With the average
                annual cost of running a team designing, building, and maintaining cars, pay, 
                transport at approximately £220,000,000 (or $265,000,000), Formula One's financial 
                and political battles are widely reported. The Formula One Group is owned by 
                Liberty Media, which acquired it in 2017 from private-equity firm CVC Capital 
                Partners for £6.4 billion ($8 billion).

            <h3 class = "second1"> History Of Formula 1 </h3>
            <p class = "second">
                Formula One was first defined in 1946 by the Commission Sportive Internationale (CSI) 
                of the FIA, forerunner of FISA, as the premier single-seater racing category in 
                worldwide motorsport to become effective in 1947. This new "International Formula" 
                was initially known variously as Formula A, Formula I, or Formula 1 with the 
                corresponding "Voiturette" formula being titled Formula B, Formula II, or Formula 2.
                When the 500cc formula was internationally recognised as Formula 3 in 1950 it was 
                never titled as "Formula C" so the three International Formulae were then "officially" 
                titled Formula 1, Formula 2 and Formula 3.
